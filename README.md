Python Learning Journey 🚀
This repository contains a collection of scripts and projects developed during my journey to master the Python programming language. It tracks my progress from basic syntax to advanced concepts and practical applications.
📁 Repository Contents
Basics & Data Structures: Implementation of fundamental data types including Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples. It also covers control flow mechanisms such as if-elif-else logic and while/for loops.  
String Manipulation (NLP Basics): Advanced text processing techniques including string cleaning, case formatting, and searching. This section explores methods like .strip(), .split(), and .replace().  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Real-world application of Classes, Inheritance, and Method Overriding. Featured project: "Zoo Management System" involving parent Animal classes and specialized Dog and Cat classes.  
Practical Projects:
Task Management System: A command-line tool to add, view, and delete daily tasks with input validation.  
Library Management System: A comprehensive system featuring book inventory management, borrowing/returning logic, and library statistics calculation.  
🛠 Skills Developed
Data Structure Management: Efficiently handling and organizing data using Python's built-in types.  
CLI Application Building: Creating interactive command-line interfaces for user input and program control.  
Logic & Problem Solving: Implementing mathematical parity checks and percentage calculations within applications.
